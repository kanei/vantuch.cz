== Description ==

Easy SwipeBox plugin for WordPress websites gives you a flexible, aesthetic and mobile-friendly Lightbox solution for just about all media links on your website. Easy SwipeBox uses the packed [SwipeBox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/?source=easy-swipebox-wp-plugin) and is multisite compatible.

2. Customization of SwipeBox lightbox appearance and behaviour from the Lightbox Settings page.
3. Autodetection of links to images or videos. You can exclude/include media types from the Autodetection Settings page.
4. Other geek settings in the Advanced Settings page.

Select one or more options from Autodetection setting page, Easy SwipeBox automatically detects the media type and add `class="swipebox"` to their links.

By default, Easy SwipeBox uses `.no-swipebox`.
